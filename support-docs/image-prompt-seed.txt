RAG Workshop — Image Generation Prompt Seed
============================================
Use this as the base style/constraint template for all workshop diagram images.
Append diagram-specific LAYOUT and COMPONENTS sections for each image.

See: modules/mod-3/img/contruction-of-context.jpeg for the reference image
that established this style.

[PROMPT SEED START]

**WORK SURFACE:** Flat technical architecture diagram on a light gray background.
Wide format (16:9 aspect ratio). Designed for a projected presentation slide,
legible from the back of a 30-person room.

**STYLE:** Clean, minimal, flat design with more visual character than a generic
corporate diagram. Each zone or component uses a distinct shape to create visual
variety (cylinders for databases, containers for applications, documents/scrolls
for text artifacts, hexagons or chips for models/processors). Muted but
distinguishable color palette — each zone has its own color identity. Sans-serif
typeface, large clear labels. Professional but not sterile — the kind of diagram
a senior engineer would sketch on a whiteboard, then clean up for a slide.

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- No title text anywhere in the diagram (titles go on the slide, not in the image)
- No photorealism
- No decorative elements (no clouds, gears, brains, robot faces, lightbulbs)
- No 3D perspective — everything flat and straight-on
- No gradients or drop shadows
- No circuit boards, neural network visualizations, or glowing elements
- No walls, barriers, doors, or doorways
- Each zone must be a visually distinct shape — not identical rounded rectangles
- Text must be large and legible at projection scale
- 16:9 aspect ratio

**INTERPRETATION:** If any element is ambiguous, favor simplicity and clarity
over visual interest. When in doubt, remove rather than add. Distinct shapes
and clear directional flow matter more than decoration.
